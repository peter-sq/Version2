                        As a healthcare organisation, you make money when clients book services from you through the platform. 
                        Regardless of the service you are providing, MyMedicalBank is designed to make clients pay you upfront
                         for services. By this you are guaranteed to receive payment for any service you provide. However the 
                         payment made will be held in trust for both the Provider and Consumer in an escrow account visible to 
                         both parties and will be released to the Provider after the service has been delivered. All payments so
                          released to you will be transferred to your bank account.</p>

                        Enterprise software solutions are very expensive to build and maintain. 
                        Aside prohibitive cost, very few healthcare organisations in Africa have in-house team of ICT professionals 
                        to manage these solutions. Subscribing to MyMedicalBank eliminates the need for Providers to build applications
                         from scratch thus reducing the costs associated with development and maintenance.
                        With corporate subscriptions costing between N20,000 and N50,000 per year, hardly will any organisation
                         be able to match the financial value the MyMedicalBank offers.</p>
